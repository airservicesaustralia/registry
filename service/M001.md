## Service Description ![](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/overview-pages-2.png)

The Aerodrome Weather data service includes routine observations made at an aerodrome throughout the day, special (i.e., non-routine) observation made at an aerodrome as needed, and forecast of meteorological conditions at an aerodrome, and modifications to those conditions throughout a specified period.

The Aerodrome Weather data service is based on three meterological reports:
- Aerodrome Weather Report (METAR),
- Special Aerodrome Weather Report (SPECI), and
- Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).

These reporting constructs are as defined in [ICAO Annex 3](https://store.icao.int/icao-annex-3), with extensions defined by the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au).

A METAR is a routine weather report issued at hourly or half-hourly intervals.  It is a description of the meteorological conditions observed at an airport at a specific time. 

A SPECI is special weather report issued when there is significant deterioration or improvement in airport weather conditions, such as significant changes of surface winds, visibility, cloud base height and occurrence of severe weather.

A TAF is a forecast of weather conditions at an airport, routinely issued four times a day for major civil aerodromes covering a 24- or 30-hour period, within a radius of 5NM of the airport reference point.

##	Message Exchange Pattern ![](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/blockchain-technology.png)

The Aerodrome Weather data service supports the Publish/Subscribe message exchange pattern, including:

- A subscription interface: Containing operations that relate to the management of the service subscription (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe, pause, resume)
- A publish interface: Dealing with the actual publication of data to consumers

![](M001-mep.png)


The Publish/Subscribe message exchange pattern is implemented with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) Version 1.0.

##	Service Interface ![](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/source-code.png)

The message exchange pattern for the service supports the following interfaces:

Operation | Resouce Endpoint | Method
--- | --- | --- | --
subscribe | etc | etc
unsubscribe | etc | etc
pause | etc | etc
resume | etc | etc
publish | etc | etc

##	Service Filtering ![](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/filled-filter.png)

The Aerodrome Weather data service supports the following filtering options:

> **Aerodrome** - specify one or more ICAO Aerodrome Codes in the subscription request to filter the results to only those locations

> **Report Type** - specify one or more of "METAR", "SPECI" or "TAF" in the subscription request to filter the results to only these types of reports

One or both filters may be used in the subscription request. 

If no filtering option is specified, then all messages will be subscribed to.
