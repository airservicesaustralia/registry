## Service Description ![](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/overview-pages-2.png)

The Weather Observations data service are routine observations made at an aerodrome throughout the day and also include special (i.e., non-routine) observation made at an aerodrome as needed.

The Weather Observations are based on the Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR) and (SPECI) reporting constructs as defined in ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No. 49-2.

The METAR is routine weather report issued at hourly or half-hourly intervals.  It is a description of the meteorological elements observed at an airport at a specific time. 

SPECI is special weather report issued when there is significant deterioration or improvement in airport weather conditions, such as significant changes of surface winds, visibility, cloud base height and occurrence of severe weather


A typical Weather Observation contains data for the temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and barometric pressure. A METAR may also contain information on precipitation amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists such as a pilot report, colour states and runway visual range.

In addition, a short period forecast may be added at the end of the METAR covering likely changes in weather conditions in the two hours following the observation.
