## Service Overview

The Weather Observation 
METAR and SPECI reporting constructs as defined in ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No. 49-2.

Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR) - literally 'Meteorological Terminal Air Report' or more straightforwardly 'Routine aerodrome meteorological report'

METAR and SPECI reports include identical information but are issued for different purposes.

METAR reports are routine observations made at an aerodrome throughout the day.  METAR observations are made (and distributed) at intervals of one hour or, if so determined by regional air navigation agreement, at intervals of one half-hour.

SPECI reports are special (i.e., non-routine) observation made at an aerodrome as needed. SPECI observations are made (and distributed) in accordance with criteria established by the meteorological authority, in consultation with the appropriate ATS authority, operators and others concerned.

METAR is routine weather report issued at hourly or half-hourly intervals.  It is a description of the meteorological elements observed at an airport at a specific time. 
SPECI is special weather report issued when there is significant deterioration or improvement in airport weather conditions, such as significant changes of surface winds, visibility, cloud base height and occurrence of severe weather

###	Brief Description of the Service

A typical METAR contains data for the temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and barometric pressure. A METAR may also contain information on precipitation amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists such as a pilot report or PIREP, colour states and runway visual range (RVR).

In addition, a short period forecast called a TREND may be added at the end of the METAR covering likely changes in weather conditions in the two hours following the observation. These are in the same format as a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).

The complement to METARs, reporting forecast weather rather than current weather, are TAFs. METARs and TAFs are used in VOLMET broadcasts.
